# NXP: Natural eXpression Parsing

> Documentation in progress and subject to changes! (Apr 2020)

NXP is a parsing library written in Python 3, inspired by [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing) and [Microsoft Monarch](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/monarch.html). 

It allows users to do two things:

- Define text patterns by combining Python objects, instead of writing complicated regular expressions.
- Define and parse complex languages, with a simple dictionary!

Is it really that simple? Don't take my word for it; read the [overview](overview) to start learning about this library, and see for yourself by practicing with the [examples](https://github.com/jhadida/nxp/tree/master/examples) provided.

## Installation

NXP is published on PyPI (the Python package index) under the name `nxp`. You will need **Python 3.6** or later installed on your machine.

To install NXP, type the following in a terminal:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade nxp
```
