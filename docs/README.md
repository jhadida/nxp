# NXP: Natural eXpression Parsing

NXP is a parsing library written in Python 3, inspired by [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing) and [Microsoft Monarch](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/monarch.html). 

It allows users to do two things:

- Define text patterns by combining Python objects, instead of writing complicated regular expressions.
- Define and parse complex languages, with a simple dictionary!

Is it really that simple? <br>
Don't take my word for it; see for yourself with the [examples](https://github.com/jhadida/nxp/tree/master/examples) provided. :blush:
