This is NOT to say that the tokens _have to_ match in that order — and in fact they do not — but rather that we _check_ for each of them in that order, one after the other. Read this again to make sure you understand the distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we can diagnose why the integer and decimal parts of `1.414` were matched separately: it is because the first token `num_integer` was able to match the integer part before `num_float` was checked, and by then the cursor had already moved on to `.414`, which is actually a valid floating-point number. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches us an important lesson when combining patterns: **when successive tokens are susceptible to match overlapping strings, it is important to list them in the \"right\" order**. In our case, we just need to reorder the tokens within the set in order to fix the problem."
