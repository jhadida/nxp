    "Now about the `[0]`: remember that a match can have **several** repetitions (see the [docs](https://jhadida.github.io/nxp/#/expr/intro?id=multiplicity)). So the reason we only see `[0]` here is simply that each of these 3 matches only captured a single occurrence of a number. We will see an example of matching with repetitions later on. <br> <br>\n",

This is NOT to say that the tokens _have to_ match in that order — and in fact they do not — but rather that we _check_ each of them in that order, one after the other. This is an important distinction to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we can diagnose why the integer and decimal parts of `1.414` were matched separately: it is because the first token `num_integer` was able to match the integer part before `num_float` was checked, and by then the cursor had already moved on to `.414`, which is actually a valid floating-point number. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches us an important lesson when combining patterns: **when successive tokens are susceptible to match overlapping strings, it is important to list them in the \"right\" order**. In our case, we just need to reorder the tokens within the set in order to fix the problem."
